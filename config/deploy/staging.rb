# Simple Role Syntax
# ==================
# Supports bulk-adding hosts to roles, the primary server in each group
# is considered to be the first unless any hosts have the primary
# property set.  Don't declare `role :all`, it's a meta role.

set :stage, :test
set :branch, 'develop'

# Extended Server Syntax
# ======================
# This can be used to drop a more detailed server definition into the
# server list. The second argument is a, or duck-types, Hash and is
# used to set extended properties on the server.

server '119.29.2.105', user: 'ubuntu', roles: %w{web app}

set :deploy_to, "/home/#{fetch(:deploy_user)}/www/simple.com"

# dont try and infer something as important as environment from
# stage name.
set :rails_env, :test

# number of unicorn workers, this will be reflected in
# the unicorn.rb and the monit configs
set :unicorn_worker_count, 5

# whether we're using ssl or not, used for building nginx
# config file
set :enable_ssl, false

# Custom SSH Options
# ==================
# You may pass any option but keep in mind that net/ssh understands a
# limited set of options, consult[net/ssh documentation](http://net-ssh.github.io/net-ssh/classes/Net/SSH.html#method-c-start).

# Global options

#    keys: %w(/home/rlisowski/.ssh/id_rsa),
#    forward_agent: false,
#    auth_methods: %w(password)
#  }
#
# And/or per server (overrides global)
# ------------------------------------
# server 'example.com',
#   user: 'user_name',
#   roles: %w{web app},
#   ssh_options: {
#     user: 'user_name', # overrides user setting above
#     keys: %w(/home/user_name/.ssh/id_rsa),
#     forward_agent: false,
#     auth_methods: %w(publickey password)
